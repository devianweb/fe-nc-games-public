# HOUSE OF GAMES FRONT END

## Background

Hey! This is my first full front end that i've built from scratch. At the moment it contains reviews, categories for those reviews and a number of comments for each review.

Technology and package wise, the front end is built using `React`, and is making requests to my server back end using javascript `fetch api`. It has been hosted on `netlify`, and is setup to rebuild itself whenever changes are pushed up to `github`. I used the `MUI` framework for this project, as I like the aesthetic and once I understood how to use it, it's really nice to work with!

## Hosting

Front End: https://devianweb-nc-games.netlify.app
Front End Repo: https://github.com/devianweb/fe-nc-games-public
Back End: https://ian-nc-games.herokuapp.com/api
Back End Repo: https://github.com/devianweb/be-nc-games-public/

## Cloning

To clone the repo, go to the github repo (`https://github.com/devianweb/fe-nc-games-public`), select the 'code' dropdown menu and then clone the repo down to your local files. This can be done using `git clone <repo-url-here>`.

## Installing dependencies

The package.json file should have been pulled down from github when you cloned it. As such, if you use the command `npm install` it should install all dependencies for you.

## Starting the app locally

To start the app locally, navigate to the folder containing the app (nc-games) and use the command `npm start`.

This front end was developed on the following versions:

node.js
